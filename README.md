# Time Complexity of Sorting Algorithms, Implementation of a Binary Search Tree

Author: [Jack Robbins](https://github.com/jackr276)

## [Part A](https://github.com/jackr276/Time-Complexity-of-Sorting-Algorithms/blob/main/partA.java)
This Java program uses a simple Java UI to collect user input and determine whether a user entered equation is balanced.

## [Part B](https://github.com/jackr276/Time-Complexity-of-Sorting-Algorithms/blob/main/partB.java)
This Java program implements BubbleSort, QuickSort, InsertionSort, and MergeSort algorithms and tests their time
complexity using lists of various sizes.

_This code tests very large arrays of integers(50,000 elements or more). Run times will vary based on your computer's single-threaded CPU performance_

## [Part C](https://github.com/jackr276/Time-Complexity-of-Sorting-Algorithms/blob/main/partC.java)
This Java program allows the user to interface with the [Binary Search Tree](https://github.com/jackr276/Time-Complexity-of-Sorting-Algorithms/blob/main/BinarySearchTree.java) class and create, print and/or modify their own binary search tree.
